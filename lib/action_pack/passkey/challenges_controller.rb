# = Action Pack Passkey Challenges Controller
#
# Generates fresh WebAuthn challenges for passkey ceremonies. The companion
# JavaScript calls this endpoint before initiating a registration or
# authentication ceremony so that the challenge is issued just-in-time rather
# than embedded in the initial page load.
#
# The generated challenge is stored in an encrypted, HTTP-only, same-site
# cookie and simultaneously returned in the JSON response body. The cookie is
# consumed by ActionPack::Passkey::Request on the subsequent form submission.
#
# == Route
#
# By default mounted at +/rails/action_pack/passkey/challenge+ (configurable
# via +config.action_pack.passkey.routes_prefix+).
